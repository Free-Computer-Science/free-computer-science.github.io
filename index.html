                        This site will function similarly <a href="theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a>, but
                        rather than focusing on software engineering, we'll dive into the theory, math, and
                        concepts that allow us to look deeper under the hood. Using blue collar trades again: If
                        a mechanic knows how to build an engine, Computer Scienctists and Engineers know how to
                        design one, and understand the physics of how to make them better. This isn't to say a
                        mechanic can't know, it's just that their domains are different!
