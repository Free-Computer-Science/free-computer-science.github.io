            <h1>Facts and Questions</h1>
    <p>Having questions is good! Having questions about the website is even better. Below is some of the questions you
        might ask while exploring the site. If you have a question that isn&apos;t listed out by the FAQ please feel free
        to <strong>contact</strong> me if needed!</p>
    <h2>1. Why is the website free? What&apos;s the catch?</h2>
    <p>There&apos;s no catch! The mission of this site is to provide accessible, quality computer science education to
        everyone, regardless of financial status. I believe that education should be open to all and that
        knowledge-sharing benefits everyone. The site is free and open-source because I want to empower self-taught
        learners, hobbyists, and professionals without any barriers to entry. You don&apos;t need to worry about hidden fees
        or locked contentâ€”everything is available for anyone who wants to learn.</p>
    <h2>2. Who is this website for?</h2>
    <p>This website is for anyone interested in computer science! Whether you&apos;re a beginner just dipping your toes into
        programming, someone who is self-taught and looking for more structure, or even a professional looking for a
        refresher on certain topics, there&apos;s something here for you. I assume a variety of experience levels, and the
        content is designed to grow with you as you develop your skills.</p>
    <h2>3. Will there be any certifications or degrees
        offered?</h2>
    <p>At this time, there are no plans to offer formal certifications or degrees. The focus of this website is purely
        educational, designed to help you build a solid foundation in computer science concepts and critical thinking.
        While there may be projects, quizzes, and assessments in the future, these are meant to aid in your learning,
        not as a formal credential.</p>
    <h2>4. How is the content organized? How should I follow
        it?</h2>
    <p>The content is organized into &quot;paths&quot; that contain courses, and within those courses, you&apos;ll find
        lessons and projects. Each lesson is designed to build upon the previous one, so it&apos;s best to follow a course
        path from start to finish if you&apos;re new to a subject. That said, you&apos;re free to jump around and explore
        different topics as you see fit. I recommend starting at the level that matches your experience and interest.
    </p>
    <h2>5. How often is content updated?</h2>
    <p>I&apos;m constantly working to improve and expand the content on this site. Updates will happen as I continue to
        refine existing lessons, add new topics, and respond to user feedback. The goal is to keep the site fresh and
        relevant to current trends in computer science, so you can expect periodic updates.</p>
    <h2>6. How can I contribute or get involved?</h2>
    <p>Since the website is 100% open-source, you&apos;re welcome to contribute to the project! Whether it&apos;s fixing bugs,
        suggesting new topics, or adding additional resources, your help is appreciated. You can find the source code on
        GitHub, where you can submit issues or pull requests. Additionally, I encourage community involvement, so feel
        free to reach out if you have ideas on how we can improve the platform together.</p>
