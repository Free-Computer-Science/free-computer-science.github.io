        A High-Level Overview of the Program
      </h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to the Free Computer Science Project! In this course we will
        take a look at the website and program as a whole, as well as set you up
        with the tools and resources that you need to start you on your journey
        in Computer Science.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        I say the word &quot;journey&quot; with intent. While for many, computer
        science is a series of classes that you take that lead you to a software
        engineering job, the study of computer science is so much more than
        that. It really is a journey: full of trial, error, missteps and the
        occasional backtrack. But it is also grand vistas, beautiful scenery,
        and a chance to see the world in a new, information-based light.
      </p>
      <p>
        For most, computer science is studied at the university-level and while
        often most individuals go on to work in developer, systems, or computer
        engineering jobs, it is incorrect to conflate the study of computer
        science completely with software engineering. Think of a mechanic: Most
        mechanics are able to understand the complex machinery of moving
        vehicles. They can take the cars apart, diagnose problems, and put them
        back together, however it is not mechanical engineering. Mechanical
        engineering can think about, reason about, and design new engines,
        vehicles, and other similar moving objects. While mechanics are not dumb
        by any regard, the focus of a mechanic, electrician, or plumber is
        different from that of a mechanical engineer, an electrical engineer, or
        a hydrodynamics engineer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, a software engineer&#39;s role and responsibility, though
        built off of what computer scientists do, is separate from that of a
        student of computer science. Software engineers often are tasked with
        resolving smaller issues or building sections of a system together.
        Sometimes they look through error logs, navigate testing, or resolve
        problems with clients. While many do learn how to program in long-dead
        languages, can think about computer systems overall, or have learned how
        to design algorithms and data structures from scratch, they often
        don&#39;t need these skills directly in work (your experience may vary
        of course).
      </p>
      <p>
        Since 2019, coding bootcamps sprung up as a way to handle the influx of
        people looking for a change in career and taught the barebones
        experience needed to work as a software engineer or web developer. These
        camps focused on the &quot;mechanic/plumber&quot; side of the scale and
        more often than not didn&#39;t delve into the theory-heavy computer
        science material.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        However, many, like myself, found themselves feeling out of place
        compared to their coworkers who had recieved their degrees in computer
        science and felt like something was lacking. I worked through OSSU, The
        Odin Project, and read through textbooks, but there is only so much you
        can do before you feel like you are in tutorial hell. As a result, I
        decided to start this website, so that you can learn computer science
        yourself without needing to pay $24,000-$100,000k over 4 years to learn
        these concepts
      </p>
      <h2>The Structure of the Program</h2>
      <p>
        The program is divided up into the following hierarchy: paths, courses,
        and lessons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paths are groupings of courses. For example, when you are first learning
        how to program you might be doing the introductory path. This path has
        three different courses in it: introduction to programming, computer
        science principles, and college placement exam preparation.
      </p>
      <p>
        I stated earlier that I wanted to have a space for people who weren&apos;t
        planning on going to college or like myself had already received their
        degree and something different but still wanted to learn computer
        science in a rigorous way.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I first started this idea, I was a high school teacher teaching a
        class built a round a certain preparation exam in the United States of
        America. Due to trademark and the legal restrictions, I want to avoid
        using the actual name of the test or its associated organization.
      </p>
      <p>
        One thing I noticed was a lack of resources that were free and weren&apos;t
        paid to play for educators like myself. This website started off as a
        simple repository for those lesson plans and a sense evolved into
        something more.
      </p>
      <p>
        As such these introductory courses are good for anyone who wants to
        start learning how to program, but I have built them, especially for
        teachers, looking for more resources to help them teach their students.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I was a teacher in the state of Texas, these courses are built around
        the Texas education and knowledge standards for their respective
        classes. You&apos;ll find at the top of each of these courses will be the
        TEKS number or which TEKS that particular lesson lines up with.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next path is called the Foundations of Computer Science path. While
        the introductory path introduces you to some ideas and some concepts in
        computer science. The foundations course will take you straight into the
        meat of computer science.
      </p>
      <p>
        You&apos;ll start off by programming and see one of the older languages that
        will be learning throughout this course. At the time of its invention, C
        was a high-level language. It was also a much simpler language than a
        lot of other languages and offered features like manual memory
        management that made it effective for systems development and allowed
        for the creation of the operating systems we use today.
      </p>
      <p>
        We teach C from beginning to end and at least get you familiar enough
        with the language so that you will be able to use it later on in the
        next courses
      </p>
      <p>
        After learning C, we start to learn algorithms and data structures.
        Interspersed in this course will be concepts in an area of math called
        discrete mathematics. You don&apos;t need to be worried, this math is also
        known as math for computer science majors and you won&apos;t have to wonder
        if there&apos;s going to be an exam afterwards that will break these concepts
        down as simply as possible so that you&apos;re able to grasp them
        step-by-step.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout that course, and the previous course will be building a
        variety of projects together so that you spend most of your time coding
        and less of your time, reading, watching and getting stuck in ““
        tutorial hell.
      </p>
      <p>
        After studying algorithms, data structures, and discrete mathematics,
        mathematics will start breaking into the machine itself, the computer
        systems. First we&#39;ll get a high-level overview of the systems that
        make up an average computer then we&apos;ll dive into the operating system.
        Learn how it works, understand what it&apos;s doing and be able to understand
        what&apos;s happening behind the scenes when programs are running on our
        computer. finally will cap it off by studying networks. After studying
        networks, servers systems algorithms, we&apos;ll study databases and learn
        the how and why of what makes them tick. For right now, this is what I
        have planned to create and develop, but eventually other course pads and
        concepts will be added in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each course is broken down into distinct lessons. Each of these lessons
        will have assignments, objectives and resources that you should read,
        watch, and do. It&apos;s important that you spend your time doing the
        assignments. They contain coding exercises, which give you opportunities
        to write code yourself and give you a chance to practice coding. It is
        not a theoretical experience or an exercise of the mind, it&apos;s a skill
        that you build by doing. Therefore, you need to be writing code.
      </p>
      <p>
        please note that everything you see here was purposefully chosen to help
        you succeed. I want you to find your footing and grow as a programmer.
        With all this in mind, let&apos;s go ahead and move onto the next lesson and
        let&apos;s find our Y as to why we are learning this content.
