        Our mission is to provide accessible, high-quality, and free computer
        science education to learners of all backgrounds. We aim to empower
        self-taught individuals, those seeking extra practice, and professionals
        needing a refresher with hands-on, university-level content. By bridging
        the gap between self-study and formal education, we foster critical
        thinking and mastery of computer science concepts. Our open-source
        platform is committed to inclusivity, ongoing growth, and building a
        supportive learning community, helping learners feel confident,
        empowered, and ready to excel in their careers.

          <h1>About Free Computer Science</h1>
          <p>
            Free Computer Science started as an unmaintained repo with a simple
            idea: What if the lessons, resources, and content needed to learn
            computer science as an field were free, open-source and available?
            While now defunct, the Open Source Lesson Plans repo was a way for
            Chris to put his lesson plans from his teaching experience in one
            place so that everyone could have them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, Free Computer Science is the start and realization of this
            dream: To provide quality, well-organized courses on the same
            material that many, if not most, universities teach at the
            undergraduate level. Your &quot;University away from University&quot;
            so-to-speak.
          </p>
          <p>
            This entire project is inspired by the amazing Odin Project as well
            as freecodecamp among others and seeks to be their &quot;content cousin&quot;
            by creating a place where people of all stripes can come and learn
            or relearn the information that is taught at universities.

            <h1>What You Will Be Able to Expect</h1>
            <p>
              This site is built similarly to The Odin Project, both out of the
              endearing love for its style and also out of an acknowledgement
              that I would not be where I am today without the countless efforts
              of volunteers working to maintain it. This site is very much a
              work in progress, but here is what you will (hopefully) be able to
              expect over time:
            </p>
            <h2>A Complete, Univeristy-style Education, For Free</h2>
            <p>
              While this is not an accedited univeristy, you will be able to
              &quot;register&quot; for classes, listen to lectures, take quizzes and exams
              to sharpen your knowledge and learn everything from Introductory
              Systems, to Compiler Building and Computer Architecture.
            </p>
            <h2>Did I Mention it Was Free?</h2>
            <p>
              Open-Source and under the MIT License, You can learn anything, at
              any time. You can even contribute, supportting the cause of open
              education for everyone.
            </p>
            <h2>Recieve Support</h2>
            <p>
              While it is still just a dream and a half away, like in off-line
              settings, you will be able to learn from knowledgeable people,
              willing to share information about their favorite subjects.
