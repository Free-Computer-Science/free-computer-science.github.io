    <p>
      I am a self-taught computer science enthusiast with a passion for coding.
      Originally, I pursued a degree in Communications, believing I was not
      &apos;math-smart&apos; enough to become a developer. After teaching high school
      computer science and realizing my love for programming, I became
      self-taught in CS, discovering that anyone can master coding with the
      right resources. I now dedicate my time to creating quality, free computer
      science education for self-taught learners like myself. Outside of coding,
      I enjoy spending time with my family, exploring the mountains of Utah, and
      long-distance running. My professional background includes C#.NET, while I
      personally enjoy working with JavaScript, Java, Go, and C.
