# Current Paths and their names in the repo: 

## Trail 1: Introductory Computer Science. Route = "/foundations"
1. Getting Started (IN PROGRESS)
2. Introduction to Programming
3. College Placement Computer Science Principles
4. Computer Science Principles for non-Students
5. College Placement Computer Science A in Java
6. Foundations of Computer Science with Java

Note: If you are a high school student or teacher, use the "College Placement" version of the program. If you are coming up on your 10-year High School reunion, you should use the Non-Students form.

## Trail 2: Basic Systems Programming in  C and Assembly
1. Basics of C Programming (IN PROGRESS)
2. Basics of Assembly
3. Introduction to Systems
4. Non-Basic Ideas in C (These ideas are important to Operating Systems)
5. Operating Systems
6. Networking: A Top-Down Approach

Note: These Courses teach the foundational processes in what makes your computer tick at its very heart. They can be a touch complicated, so if you feel like you want to skip to algorithms for now, feel free.

## Trail 3: Algorithms, Data Structures, and Discrete Structures (Discrete Math, but shhhhhh)
1. Introductions to Algorithms in Java, C, or Python
2. Data Structures in Java, C, or Python
3. Discrete Structures

Note: All of the courses provided are available in Java, C, and Python. Discrete Structures will be the same regardless of the language.
